Therefore, the alloying behavior of any given principal element is signiﬁcantly affected by all the other principal elements present. In order to elucidate this further, the inﬂuence of iron, silver and gold addition on the microstructure and hardness of AlCoCrCuNi-based equimolar alloys has been examined. The as-cast AlCoCrCuNi base alloy is found to have a dendritic structure, of which only solid solution FCC and BCC phases can be observed. The BCC dendrite has a chemical composition close to that of the nominal alloy, with a deﬁciency in copper however, which is found to segregate and form a FCC Cu-rich interdendrite. The microstructure of the iron containing alloys is similar to that of the base alloy. It is found that both of these aforementioned alloys have hardnesses of about 420 HV, which is equated to their similar microstructures.\n",

The modulated structure of the dendrite region consisting of BCC and ordered BCC (B2) phases, is considered to result from spinodal decomposition, as previously reported and discussed in detail for AlxCoCrCuFeNi high entropy alloys (x = 0–3) [7]. Thus, the FCC phase is of the interdendrite region. From Fig. 2, can be seen to be a higher volume fraction of dendrite than interdendrite. This is in agreement with the relative peak intensities of the BCC and FCC peak intensities of x = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05 and 0.0, respectively.
